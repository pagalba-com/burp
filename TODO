The list of things to do is at:
https://github.com/grke/burp/issues

However, that is mostly relating to protocol1 issues.


So, this is a list of important stuff that needs to be done for protocol2,
roughly in order of most important to least.

* Need to improve restore speed - come up with a way to efficiently read the
  blocks into memory by looking ahead in the manifests.

* Make the status monitor work.

* Add data compression.

* Add data encryption.

* Make Windows EFS work.

* Make Windows 'image' backups work.


List of things that are not recorded as issues on GitHub:

* Add diff with next backup, i.e.
    burp -a d
        Report  the  differences  between  the  current backup and the backup
        that will be made next.
    burp -a d -b 2 -b n
        Report  the  differences between backup 1 and the backup that will be
        made next (use -a D for more verbosity).
