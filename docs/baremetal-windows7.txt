Windows 7 bare metal restore steps
----------------------------------

Thanks to:
Wai Keong Phan, who first completed a bare metal restore, wrote up the
	first draft and provided help when I was stuck.
Michael Da Cova, who also provided help when I was stuck.


a) Install the burp client on Windows 7.

b) Make a burp backup of your C: drive (plus any others you want to keep).
That means that 'include = C:/' should be in the client burp.conf.
You may also 'exclude = C:/pagefile.sys', because it is known to be pointless
to backup that file.

c) Download MS Win AIK via this link (at the time of writing):
	http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=5753

d) Install MS Win AIK

e) Run a command prompt with administrator privileges, and execute these
	commands:
   > copype.cmd amd64 c:\winpe_amd64
   > cd c:\winpe_amd64
   > copy winpe.wim iso\sources\boot.wim
   > dism /mount-wim /wimfile:iso\sources\boot.wim /index:1 /mountdir:mount

   (at this point, I found it easiest to copy the whole 'C:\Program Files\Burp'
    directory to mount\windows, although you may just install it on the target
    machine via a file server later)

   > dism /unmount-wim /mountdir:mount /commit
   > oscdimg -n -betfsboot.com iso winpe_amd64.iso

f) Make a bootable CD with the iso image.

g) With a new or reprovisioned machine, boot the machine up with WinPE. It
   will go to a command prompt that looks like 'X:\windows\system32>'

h) Create a new 'C:' partition by executing these commands:
   > select disk 0
   > create partition primary
   > active
   > assign letter=C

   You can change 'ntfs' to something else in the following command:

   > format fs=ntfs quick

   To verify disk status:

   > detail disk

i) At this point, you can grab the burp client installer from your file server,
   if you did not but it on the WinPE disk in step (e). Make sure the
   appropriate burp server name, burp client name and password are entered
   during the installer.

j) Start the restore by executing the following command:

   > "cd C:\Program Files\Burp\bin"
   > burp.exe -a r -f -d /

k) Shutdown the machine.

l) Reboot from a Windows 7 installation disk.

m) Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and
   click next. It doesn't matter what you choose here, as long as you can
   continue to provide input.

n) Select 'Repair your computer'.

o) Follow the menus to a command prompt. You need to run diskpart again to
   make the 'C:' partition active, and then rebuild the boot sector.

   > select disk 0
   > select partition primary
   > active
   > bootrec /rebuildbcd

p) Reboot into the Windows 7 installation disk twice more, selecting 'Repair
   your computer' both times.

q) Windows 7 should now boot from the disk by itself.

Unresolved issues:

There is something a bit weird about the entries in the top level of the
file system, though. I have these odd directories:

C:\$Recycle.Bin
C:\Documents and Settings
C:\System Volume Information
C:\Temp
C:\C:   <- Very odd because ':' is not a valid character in Windows names.

I think most of these exist on the original system, but are somehow hidden.


It has also given me a new small E:\ partition. Perhaps that was something
to do with the recovery via the installation disk.
