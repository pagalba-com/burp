Windows 2008 bare metal restore steps
-------------------------------------

Unfortunately, I have not yet completed a Windows 2008 bare metal restore.
The process should be nearly identical to the Windows 7 steps, but I get stuck
at the point of making the new disk bootable.

TODO: Have another go at this. Perhaps I need to create a different version
of the WinPE disk.


However, burp user Dave Ludlow reports success with burp 2.0.54 and Server 2008
R2 using the Windows 7 and 8 instructions:

"The only catch is that I restored to a Virtual Machine and had to handle the
change of hardware causing 0x7B BSODs on boot.

I used a registry patch from http://www.andysblog.de/windows-mergeide-v3-0 to do
it.  It adds support for the basic IDE/SCSI drivers in just a couple of
keystrokes during the WinPE portion of the restore."
